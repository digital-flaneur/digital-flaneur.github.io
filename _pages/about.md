I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University, advised by [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/). I am broadly interested in human-AI collaboration, data science, and data visualization. Currently, I use large language models and data science methods to develop adaptive, scalable, and interactive human-centered technology for data visualization and education. I am passionate about advancing human-AI collaboration to improve our productivity and creativity.

During my Ph.D., I've had the fortune to work across institutions to explore my interdisciplinary interests: I co-direct [EAAMO Bridges](https://eaamo-bridges.netlify.app), a commuity that leverages computational methods to improve welfare for marginalized groups. I was a social data science researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en), where I studied mortality estimation in data-scarce contexts. Previously, I was a graduate fellow at [Stanford's RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu), where I developed computational methods for disparity estimation in public health. I also served as a [Data Science for Social Good (DSSG)](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with 988 Lifeline to improve its service through data-driven call routing.
