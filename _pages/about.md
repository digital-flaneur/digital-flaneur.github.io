I am a researcher passionate about advancing **human-AI collaboration** to improve our productivity and creativity. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Northwestern University, advised by [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/). My thesis research includes using **data science** methods and **large language models** to build **adaptive, scalable, and human-centered technology for data visualization and education**. I use a variety of approaches in research, including quantitative and qualitative analysis of human-computer and human-human interactions, as well as designing, developing, and evaluating systems.

I also worked across institutions to explore my interdisciplinary interests: I co-directed [EAAMO Bridges](https://eaamo-bridges.netlify.app), a community that leverages computational methods to improve welfare for marginalized groups. I studied mortality estimation as a social data science researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en). I developed statistical methods for disparity estimation as a graduate fellow at [Stanford's RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu). I also built machine learning solutions for the 988 Lifeline as a [Data Science for Social Good](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) fellow at Carnegie Mellon University.
