I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University, advised by [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/). My research explores the intersection of algorithms, data science, and human-computer interaction. Currently, I'm interested in developing rigorous, adaptive methods to assess and understand visualization literacy. I'm passionate about understanding and guiding human behavior and system design to bring positive social impact to our world.

I co-organize the [Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG)](https://www.md4sg.com/) research initiative with [Francisco J. Marmolejo Coss√≠o](https://www.fmarmolejo.com/), [George Obaido](https://georgeobaido.com/), [Matthew Olckers](https://www.matthewolckers.com/), [Ana-Andreea Stoica](http://www.columbia.edu/~as5001/), [Lily Xu](https://lily-x.github.io/).

I'm currently serving as a summer fellow at Stanford's [RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu), studying racial dispatity in healthcare through the lens of computer science and public policy. I served as a [Data Science for Social Good](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in Summer 2022, where I worked with Vibrant Emotional Health to improve the service of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline through data-driven call routing.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
