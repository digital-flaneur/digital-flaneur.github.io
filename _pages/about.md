I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University, advised by [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/). I am broadly interested in advancing human-AI collaboration to improve our productivity and creativity. In particular, my thesis research includes using data science methods and large language models to build adaptive, scalable, and interactive technology to measure and promote data visualization literacy and help teachers develop educational assessments. I use a variety of methods in research, including quantitative/qualitative analysis of human-computer interactions and developing/evaluating systems.

I also worked across institutions to explore my interdisciplinary interests: I co-direct [EAAMO Bridges](https://eaamo-bridges.netlify.app), a commuity that leverages computational methods to improve welfare for marginalized groups. I studied mortality estimation as a social data science researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en). I developed statistical methods for disparity estimation as a graduate fellow at [Stanford's RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu). I also built machine learning solutions for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline as a [Data Science for Social Good (DSSG)](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) fellow at Carnegie Mellon University.
