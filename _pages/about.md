I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University, advised by [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/). I am broadly interested in human-AI collaboration, data science, and data visualization. Currently, I use large language models and data science methods to develop adaptive, scalable, and quality-oriented education technology for data visualization. I am passionate about advancing human-AI collaboration to improve our productivity and creativity.

During my Ph.D., I have had the fortune to collaborate with many brilliant minds across disciplines and institutions: I co-direct [EAAMO Bridges](https://eaamo-bridges.netlify.app) (formerly [MD4SG](https://www.md4sg.com)), which leverages computational methods to improve equity and welfare for marginalized groups. I am a visiting researcher in social data science at the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en), where I study population-level mortality estimation in data-scarce contexts. Previously, I was a graduate fellow at Stanford's [RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu), where I developed computational methods for racial disparity estimation in public health. I also served as a [Data Science for Social Good (DSSG)](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in 2022, where I worked with Vibrant Emotional Health to improve the service of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline through data-driven call routing.
