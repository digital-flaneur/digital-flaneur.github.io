I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University, advised by [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/). My research explores the intersection of algorithms, data science, and human-computer interaction. Currently, I use large language models and data science methods to develop education technology in data visualization. I'm passionate about advancing human-AI collaboration to improve our productivity and creativity.

I co-organize [EAAMO Bridges](https://www.md4sg.com/) (formerly MD4SG), which leverages computational methods to improve equity and welfare for marginalized groups. Additionally, I was a graduate fellow at Stanford's [RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu) where I developed computational methods for racial disparity estimation in public health. I also served as a [Data Science for Social Good (DSSG)](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in 2022, where I worked with Vibrant Emotional Health to improve the service of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline through data-driven call routing.
