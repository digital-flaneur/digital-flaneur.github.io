I like eating food and making food, and I invest quite a bit of my leisure time on both. I'm a picky eater because it's a lot harder for me to say "I really enjoyed it" than most people with whom I've dined; also, the set of restaurants I like tend to be a small proper subset of the set of restaurants a friend has tried and like. At the same time, I'm not a picky eater in that I would still eat whatever's on the table (with high probability).

All of the restaurants listed here are places I like, and I have visited many of them multiple times. The cardinality of the set of restaurants I've tried but didn't like far exceed the number of places on this page; I choose not to present that set because there are many possible reasons that my experience does not reflect the true quality of a restaurant: (1) I could have ordered the wrong the items; (2) cooking performance is a Gaussian random variable and has variance, so I could have just gotten unlucky; (3) I could have been in a bad mood which affected how I perceived the food.

Some people factor service and vibes into their restaurant ratings. While that is reasonable, **my ratings are about the food itself**. From my limited observations, service, vibes, and food definitely do not have clear positive relationships among each other. Ratings are from 1 to 3, and below is a rough description of what each score means.

- 3: It is worth spending 2 hours getting there and waiting just for the food.
- 2: Somewhere between 1 and 3.
- 1: If you happen to be close, it's a good spot to try.

What to order at a restaurant is crucial in making helpful food recs. You can find what I like to order in the tables below.

**Disclaimer**: My taste is defined by my own experiences with food and maybe some genetics as well. The recommendations and reviews below are highly personal and biased, as they should be.
