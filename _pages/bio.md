### Hello!

My name is Yuan Cui (崔元), and I also go by Charles. I work with data and try to make a positive social impact with my work.

- **2020 - present**: Northwestern University.
  Following my passion for computer science, I joined the CS Ph.D. program at Northwestern. I started out grad school stuyding the intersection of economics and computation. I spent my first one and a half years taking theoretical computer science courses as well as many Ph.D. level of economics courses. Loving the abstract beauty of math and theories but yearning for solving more applied and social-impact centered research problems, I pivoted to studying human-computer interaction. In addition, I sought opportunities to develop expertise in tech for social impact work and deepen my understanding of the research-to-practice pipeline.

  - **2020 - present**: Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG)
    <!-- description goes here. what i did and lessons learned. -->
  - **Summer 2022**: Data Science for Social Good (DSSG)
    <!-- description goes here. what i did and lessons learned. -->
  - **Summer 2023**: Graduate Student Fellow at Stanford RegLab
    <!-- description goes here. what i did and lessons learned. -->

  At the same time, I developed leadership, management, and communication skills outside of my academic work. I gained consulting and project management experience while serving as the Vice President of University and Alumni relatons at the Advanced Degree Consulting Aliance (ADCA), as well as co-founding the Impact Consulting Chicago and serving as the Head of Business Development.

- **2016 - 2020**: Oberlin College.
  I majored in mathematics and computer science. Mathematics showed me a powerful way of seeing and understanding the world, and I felt in love with it instantly. I took as many math and theoretical computer science classes as I could, and studied abroad at [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/). I did research with multiple professors on topics including economics and computation, primality testing, and machine learning. My undergraduate thesis examined how simple modifications of the deferred acceptance matching algorithm affects perceived fairness and strategic behavior of school applicants. I graduatd with high honor and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. I'm grateful for the tight-knit Oberlin community woven together with love and compassion, and I was fortunate to be mentored by [Jack Calcut](https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/jcalcut/), [Ben Linowitz](https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/blinowit/), and [Sam Taggart](http://samueltaggart.com/). I learned the technical and reasoning skills to analyze problems with quantitative rigor. I aslo learned the importance of community building and mentorship.

<!-- My four years at Oberlin left precious and indelible traces in my life. I will always cherish this tight-knit community woven together with love and compassion. It nurtured my heart and changed me in many fundamental ways. There was never a lack of passion for intellectual adventures. I have met mentors and friends who inspired me to grow, showed me to be courageous, and beyond all, loved me and taught me how to love. Therefore, I'm a strong advocate of the small liberal arts college education. I'm currently serving as a Class Ambassador to help fundraise for the [Oberlin Annual Fund](https://advance.oberlin.edu/donate).

I was born and raised in Hohhot (呼和浩特), Inner Mongolia (内蒙古) until moving to Beijing (北京) at the age of 11, where I met my life-long family of teachers and friends at <a href="http://www.bj35.com/site/">志成中学</a>. I also lived in D.C. and Cleveland for about 3 years before college. -->
