### Hello!

My name is Yuan Cui (崔元), and I also go by Charles. I work with data and try to make a positive social impact with my work.

- **2020 - present**: Northwestern University.

  Following my passion for computer science, I joined the CS Ph.D. program at Northwestern. I started out grad school thinking I would pursue research in economics and computation. I spent my first one and a half years taking theoretical computer science courses as well as many Ph.D. level of economics courses. Loving the abstract beauty of math and theories but yearning for more applocation and direct impact in practice, I pivoted to studying human-computer interaction.

- **2016 - 2020**: Oberlin College.

  I majored in mathematics and computer science. I felt in love with mathematics, took as many math and theoretical computer science classes as I could, and studied abroad at [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/). I did research with multiple professors on topics including economics and computation, primality testing, and machine learning. My undergraduate thesis examined how high honor and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. I'm grateful for the tight-knit Oberlin community woven together with love and compassion, and I was fortunate to be mentored by [Jack Calcut](https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/jcalcut/), [Ben Linowitz](https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/blinowit/), and [Sam Taggart](http://samueltaggart.com/).

<!-- My four years at Oberlin left precious and indelible traces in my life. I will always cherish this tight-knit community woven together with love and compassion. It nurtured my heart and changed me in many fundamental ways. There was never a lack of passion for intellectual adventures. I have met mentors and friends who inspired me to grow, showed me to be courageous, and beyond all, loved me and taught me how to love. Therefore, I'm a strong advocate of the small liberal arts college education. I'm currently serving as a Class Ambassador to help fundraise for the [Oberlin Annual Fund](https://advance.oberlin.edu/donate).

I was born and raised in Hohhot (呼和浩特), Inner Mongolia (内蒙古) until moving to Beijing (北京) at the age of 11, where I met my life-long family of teachers and friends at <a href="http://www.bj35.com/site/">志成中学</a>. I also lived in D.C. and Cleveland for about 3 years before college. -->
