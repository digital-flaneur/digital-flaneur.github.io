Previously, I received my B.A. at [Oberlin College](https://www.oberlin.edu/) in 2020, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Jack Calcut](https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/jcalcut/), [Ben Linowitz](https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/blinowit/), and [Sam Taggart](http://samueltaggart.com/). I also studied abroad at [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/).

My four years at Oberlin College left precious and indelible traces in my life. I will always cherish this tight-knit community woven together with love and compassion. It nurtured my heart and changed me in many fundamental ways. There was never a lack of passion for intellectual adventures. I have met mentors and friends who inspired me to grow, showed me to be courageous, and beyond all, loved me and taught me how to love. Therefore, I'm a strong advocate of the small liberal arts college education. I'm currently serving as a Class Ambassador to help fundraise for the [Oberlin Annual Fund](https://advance.oberlin.edu/donate).

I spent my first 11 years in Inner Mongolia until moving to Beijing, where I met my life-long family of teachers and friends at <a href="http://www.bj35.com/site/">志成中学</a>. I also lived in D.C. and Cleveland for 2.5 years before college.
