  title={Odds and Insights: Decision Quality in Visual Analytics Under Uncertainty},
  author={Sarma, Abhraneel, and Pu, Xiaoying, and Cui, Yuan, and Brown, Eli T, and Correll, Michael, and Kay, Matthew},
  abstract={Recent studies have shown that users of visual analytics tools can have difficulty distinguishing robust findings in the data from statistical noise, but the true extent of this problem is likely dependent on both the incentive structure motivating their decisions, and the ways that uncertainty and variability are (or are not) represented in visualisations. In this work, we perform a crowd-sourced study measuring decision-making quality in visual analytics, testing both an explicit structure of incentives designed to reward cautious decision-making as well as a variety of designs for communicating uncertainty. We find that, while participants are unable to perfectly control for false discoveries as well as idealised statistical models such as the Benjamini-Hochberg, certain forms of uncertainty visualisations can improve the quality of participants’ decisions and lead to fewer false discoveries than not correcting for multiple comparisons. We conclude with a call for researchers to further explore visual analytics decision quality under different decision-making contexts, and for designers to directly present uncertainty and reliability information to users of visual analytics tools.

  title={Adaptive Assessment of Visualization Literacy},
  author={Cui, Yuan, and Ge, Lily W., and Ding, Yiren, and Yang, Fumeng, and Harrison, Lane, and Kay, Matthew},
  abstract={Visualization literacy is an essential skill for accurately interpreting data to inform critical decisions. Consequently, it is
vital to understand the evolution of this ability and devise targeted interventions to enhance it, requiring concise and repeatable
assessments of visualization literacy for individuals. However, current assessments, such as the Visualization Literacy Assessment
Test (VLAT), are time-consuming due to their fixed, lengthy format. To address this limitation, we develop two streamlined computerized
adaptive tests (CATs) for visualization literacy, A-VLAT and A-CALVI, which measure the same set of skills as their original versions in
half the number of questions. Specifically, we (1) employ item response theory (IRT) and non-psychometric constraints to construct
adaptive versions of the assessments, (2) finalize the configurations of adaptation through simulation, (3) refine the composition of test
items of A-CALVI via a qualitative study, and (4) demonstrate the test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.98 and 0.98) and convergent validity
(correlation: 0.81 and 0.66) of both CATs via four online studies. We discuss practical recommendations for using our CATs and
opportunities for further customization to leverage the full potential of adaptive assessments.},

  title={CALVI: Critical Thinking Assessment for Literacy in Visualizations},
  author={Ge, Lily W., and Cui, Yuan, and Kay, Matthew},
  abstract={Visualization misinformation is a prevalent problem, and combating it requires understanding people’s ability to read, interpret, and reason about erroneous or potentially misleading visualizations, which lacks a reliable measurement: existing visualization literacy tests focus on well-formed visualizations. We systematically develop an assessment for this ability by: (1) developing a precise definition of misleaders (decisions made in the construction of visualizations that can lead to conclusions not supported by the data), (2) constructing initial test items using a design space of misleaders and chart types, (3) trying out the provisional test on 497 participants, and (4) analyzing the test tryout results and refining the items using Item Response Theory, qualitative analysis, a wrong-due-to-misleader score, and the content validity index. Our final bank of 45 items shows high reliability, and we provide item bank usage recommendations for future tests and different use cases.},

  author={McElfresh, Duncan, and Dooley, Samuel, and Cui, Yuan, and Griesman, Kendra, and Wang, Weiqin, and Will, Tyler, and Sehgal, Neil, and Dickerson, John},
  abstract={Planning for death is not a process in which everyone participates. Yet a lack of planning can severely impact a patient’s well-being, the well-being of her family, and the medical community as a whole. Advance Care Planning (ACP) has been a field in the United States for a half-century, and often using short surveys or questionnaires to help patients consider future end of life (EOL) care decisions. Recent web-based tools promise to increase ACP participation rates; modern techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) could further improve and personalize these tools. We discuss two hypothetical AI-based apps and their potential implications. We hope that this paper will encourage thought about appropriate applications of AI in ACP as well as implementation of AI to ensure patient intentions are honored.},
