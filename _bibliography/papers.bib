  title={Adaptive Assessment of Visualization Literacy},
  author={Cui, Yuan, and Ge, Lily W., and Ding, Yiren, and Yang, Fumeng, and Harrison, Lane, and Kay, Matthew},
  abstract={Visualization literacy is an essential skill for accurately interpreting data to inform critical decisions. Consequently, it is
vital to understand the evolution of this ability and devise targeted interventions to enhance it, requiring concise and repeatable
assessments of visualization literacy for individuals. However, current assessments, such as the Visualization Literacy Assessment
Test (VLAT), are time-consuming due to their fixed, lengthy format. To address this limitation, we develop two streamlined computerized
adaptive tests (CATs) for visualization literacy, A-VLAT and A-CALVI, which measure the same set of skills as their original versions in
half the number of questions. Specifically, we (1) employ item response theory (IRT) and non-psychometric constraints to construct
adaptive versions of the assessments, (2) finalize the configurations of adaptation through simulation, (3) refine the composition of test
items of A-CALVI via a qualitative study, and (4) demonstrate the test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.98 and 0.98) and convergent validity
(correlation: 0.81 and 0.66) of both CATs via four online studies. We discuss practical recommendations for using our CATs and
opportunities for further customization to leverage the full potential of adaptive assessments.},

@article{calvi,
  abbr={ACM CHI},
  title={CALVI: Critical Thinking Assessment for Literacy in Visualizations},
  author={Ge, Lily W., and Cui, Yuan, and Kay, Matthew},
  abstract={Visualization misinformation is a prevalent problem, and combating it requires understanding people’s ability to read, interpret, and reason about erroneous or potentially misleading visualizations, which lacks a reliable measurement: existing visualization literacy tests focus on well-formed visualizations. We systematically develop an assessment for this ability by: (1) developing a precise definition of misleaders (decisions made in the construction of visualizations that can lead to conclusions not supported by the data), (2) constructing initial test items using a design space of misleaders and chart types, (3) trying out the provisional test on 497 participants, and (4) analyzing the test tryout results and refining the items using Item Response Theory, qualitative analysis, a wrong-due-to-misleader score, and the content validity index. Our final bank of 45 items shows high reliability, and we provide item bank usage recommendations for future tests and different use cases.},
