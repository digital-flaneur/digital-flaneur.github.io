I will be joining the [Population and Social Data Science Summer Incubator](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/research_6120/digital_and_computational_demography_zagheni_11666/population_and_social_data_science_summer_incubator_program_11935) at the [Max Planck Institue for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en) in Germany from early June to late August this summer.
